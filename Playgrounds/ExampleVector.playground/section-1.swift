// Vectors can be created by using an array literal
var vector : Vector<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
vector.description

// But it's better to do this by using this function
vector = Vector<Int>.build([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
vector.description

// You can add more elements to an existing vector by using the append function or the `+` operator
vector = vector + 6

// And by popping you can remove the last element in the vector
vector = vector.pop()
vector.description

// Vectors are Iterables:
for integer in vector {
    integer
}

// And as all Iterables, are Traversable. Both protocols working together give our vectors access to a great deal of utility functions.
